    A Patch object represents a single SQL patch. Such a patch contains SQL
    directives to transform the database's current schema to a new schema and
    possibly directives to revert such a step.

    The patch may contain one or more dependencies, which means patches that
    need to be applied before this patch can be applied itsself. Dependencies
    may be optional, in which case it is acceptable for the patch to not exist.
    In case optional, depended-upon patches exist and aren't applied, they need
    to be applied before this patch.
